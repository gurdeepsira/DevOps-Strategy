The business problem



What is DevOps?

DevOps can be defined as a culture or process or practise within an organization that increases the
communication, collaboration and integration of the Development (which includes the QA team)
and the Operations (IT Operations) teams. The aim is to automate and speed up the software
delivery process much more frequently and reliably. 

Benefits?

Significantly shorter time-to-market
• Improved customer satisfaction
• Better product quality
• More reliable releases
• Improved productivity and efficiency
• The increased ability to build the right product by fast experimentation 

Where to begin?

Embracing DevOps methodologies requires a holistic effort and a
fundamental change from current IT procedures. Substantially
different from older offshoring programs to cut costs, DevOps is
about investing in existing staff to significantly increase
productivity and velocity. As such, accomplishing this change
requires a careful assessment of the current state, gap analysis,
solid strategy to reach the desired end goal, and strong leadership
to get there.
A strategic approach to achieving a successful DevOps
environment includes the following components that cover
technologies, practices, and people:
Current state assessment – Review and document existing
software development lifecycle - design, code, deliver, test, deploy
- including workflow, topology, and challenges; record manual,
ad-hoc, and inconsistent processes.
Business and technical objectives – Identify business goals related
to product releases and the challenges in current release cycles to
achieve desired objectives of business and technology teams;
establish most impactful areas to the enterprise.
Release objectives – Discover release goals including deployment
frequencies and motives.
Success parameters and metrics – Develop metrics across the full
DevOps application lifecycle to track progress such as process
productivity, and speed of deployment versus defect leakage;
define success parameters; measure current state as baseline for
future comparisons and evidence-based improvements.
End-state vision – Define full scope of end-state operations
including: DevOps practices, communications and collaboration
planning, infrastructure as code (IaC) processes, automated testing,
and streamlined release management; identify continuous
development, integration, testing, deployment, and operations
tools.
Life cycle needs
• Development: automated provisioning, software
configuration management (SCM) and versioning, build
scripts, dependency maps, component deployment, and
system deployment
• Testing: test scripts, test deployment, risk-based testing,
regression rationalization, load/soak scripts, data
provisioning, baseline benchmark, test reports
• Operations: image management, patch management,
automated environment deployment, start/stop scripts,
rolling upgrades, security configurations
Change management – Prepare for disruption in roles, workflow,
and culture; invest in change management experts and leadership;
build plans for cross-department communications and goal
alignment; anticipate needs for new resources where skill sets are
missing.
