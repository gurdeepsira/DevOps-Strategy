The business problem



What is DevOps?

DevOps can be defined as a culture or process or practise within an organization that increases the
communication, collaboration and integration of the Development (which includes the QA team)
and the Operations (IT Operations) teams. The aim is to automate and speed up the software
delivery process much more frequently and reliably. 


Software is built and shipper to operations or
customers > Services are running and managed

Development of features are done > Services are never done until they are turned off

Each silo owns its own area All groups collectively own quality, reliability and
security

Dev must go through Ops to get work done Ops enables Dev to get work done (no more gatekeepers, but policies, guardrails and automation)


Benefits?

Significantly shorter time-to-market
• Improved customer satisfaction
• Better product quality
• More reliable releases
• Improved productivity and efficiency
• The increased ability to build the right product by fast experimentation 

Where to begin?

Embracing DevOps methodologies requires a holistic effort and a
fundamental change from current IT procedures. Substantially
different from older offshoring programs to cut costs, DevOps is
about investing in existing staff to significantly increase
productivity and velocity. As such, accomplishing this change
requires a careful assessment of the current state, gap analysis,
solid strategy to reach the desired end goal, and strong leadership
to get there.
A strategic approach to achieving a successful DevOps
environment includes the following components that cover
technologies, practices, and people:
Current state assessment – Review and document existing
software development lifecycle - design, code, deliver, test, deploy
- including workflow, topology, and challenges; record manual,
ad-hoc, and inconsistent processes.
Business and technical objectives – Identify business goals related
to product releases and the challenges in current release cycles to
achieve desired objectives of business and technology teams;
establish most impactful areas to the enterprise.
Release objectives – Discover release goals including deployment
frequencies and motives.
Success parameters and metrics – Develop metrics across the full
DevOps application lifecycle to track progress such as process
productivity, and speed of deployment versus defect leakage;
define success parameters; measure current state as baseline for
future comparisons and evidence-based improvements.
End-state vision – Define full scope of end-state operations
including: DevOps practices, communications and collaboration
planning, infrastructure as code (IaC) processes, automated testing,
and streamlined release management; identify continuous
development, integration, testing, deployment, and operations
tools.

Life cycle needs

• Development: automated provisioning, software
configuration management (SCM) and versioning, build
scripts, dependency maps, component deployment, and
system deployment

• Testing: test scripts, test deployment, risk-based testing,
regression rationalization, load/soak scripts, data
provisioning, baseline benchmark, test reports

• Operations: image management, patch management,
automated environment deployment, start/stop scripts,
rolling upgrades, security configurations
Change management – Prepare for disruption in roles, workflow,
and culture; invest in change management experts and leadership;
build plans for cross-department communications and goal
alignment; anticipate needs for new resources where skill sets are
missing.

DevOps pipeline – Build prioritized pipeline of new and existing
applications to transition into DevOps environment.
Budget – Create financial plan for the journey to the desired
end-state including infrastructure, tools, services, and engineers.
After these items have been integrated into a strategic plan and
approved by management, it is time to begin with a DevOps pilot:
DevOps Pilot – Acquire initial tools and infrastructure; pilot 1-2
applications to test DevOps concepts; calculate metrics and impact;
share success with broader organization.
Opportunities for improvement – Learn from mistakes, document
best practices, close toolchain and technology gaps, alter pipeline,
and implement organizational change as needed.
After a successful pilot, the next step in a strategic DevOps
approach is transitioning projects from the pipeline into the new
application development lifecycle, applying adjustments as needed.
It’s important to build empathy into the journey as modifications to
roles and responsibilities are inevitable, and change can be
unsettling. True DevOps success is only achieved when the entire
organization is working together. But it takes some time to get
there. 

Critical Success Factors

Critical Success Factors
There are a handful of critical considerations that require special
attention for the road to DevOps success as follows:
Cloud DevOps Advancements
While some companies must keep software development and
testing onsite due to compliance constraints, others find it
beneficial to shift the entire DevOps environment to the cloud.
A primary reason is the breadth of tools and resources now
available from cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services
(AWS), Azure, Google, and IBM. A second factor is the challenge -
both time and cost - of getting a complete toolchain set up and
maintained in house.
AWS, for example, provides a set of flexible services to simplify
provisioning, infrastructure, deployment, and monitoring. AWS
DevOps requires minimal setup, scales fast, and charges only for
services used. Furthermore, advanced DevOps tools, such as
CloudFormation templates, EC2 Container Service, and Lambda
provide comparable functionality to corresponding on premise
solutions.
Know the DevOps Toolchain
As DevOps has gained momentum, the breadth and depth of tools
has exploded and now provide substantial benefits to
development, QA, and operations teams. Containerization tools,
such as Docker and Kubernetes, have received the most attention
and deserve that focus given their contribution to productivity. But
solutions across the DevOps lifecycle are driving significant gains.
Given the proliferation of tools, developer preferences vary.
A common starting point is using solutions familiar to the current
team. However, it’s critical to keep abreast of advancements by
reading industry blogs, and attending user groups and
conferences. News spreads fast by word-of-mouth in the
application development community. Thus, networking is
important until the toolchain ecosystem becomes more mature.
